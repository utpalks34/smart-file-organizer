This is a small Python script that automatically organizes the files inside any folder.
You just need to run the script and paste the folder path, and it will arrange all your files into proper categories like Images, Documents, Videos, Code, etc.

I built this mainly to clean my Downloads folder, and it actually saves a lot of time.

Features

Creates separate folders like:

Images

Documents

Videos

Archives

Others

Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac

Very simple to use


#How to run

2.Open terminal / cmd inside the project folder

3.Run:

When asked, paste the directory path you want to organize
(Example: C:\Users\Username\Downloads)

#thank you
